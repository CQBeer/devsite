NULS Community Profile</strong></h2> <p>NULS is a blockchain infrastructure for customizable services and a global open-source community. The designed technical architecture of NULS consists of a micro-kernel and functional modules. With innovative ideas on reducing the main block chain and decoupling events and services, high modularization on underlying architecture is achieved. The NULS project, following the principles of hot plugging, modularization and parallel expansion, provides smart contracts, multi-chain mechanism and cross-chain consensus to reduce cost of development and use, and to promote the application of blockchain in the commercial field. With the proposal of basic framework containing modular thinking and multi-chain mechanism, NULS upholds the “chain” as its core development philosophy and is striving for building a core product - “Chain Factory” where users can select core function modules as they like to create their own blockchains on the NULS chain network and define their own business logic with little programming, to include smart contracts.</p> <p><strong>NULS community is an organization of a group of people who highly assent to NULS community culture and philosophy and have the same purpose and vision to work for the development of NULS community ecology.</strong> NULS community members include the NULS Foundation, Council members, contributors, the open-source technology community - CODE CRAFT COUNCIL (CCC) and other all NULS Holders.</p> <h2 id="ii-nuls-foundation"><a href="#ii-nuls-foundation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>II.

Before that they need to present output worthy and recognized to include a period of adaptation (1 or 2 months generally).</p> <p>The process of joining CCC is:</p> <ol><li>Have a preliminary communication with a CCC developer to briefly introduce his / her own experience and skilled programming language.</li> <li>Select tasks they are interested in and capable of. We will let developers join in each development taskforce to work with each other.</li> <li>Leader of the taskforce will provide necessary documentary information to help developers start in an efficient, expedient manner. We also hope developers can maintain effective communication with one another for smooth, ease of work. About 1 month later, the developer who remains consistent with the work and produces a high-quality product, can file a node application with the technology community.</li> <li>After intense review by the technology community and core team, the developer will be one of the CCC if the application is approved.</li></ol> <h3 id><a href="#" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3> <h3 id="iv-rights-and-responsibilities-of-the-ccc-member"><a href="#iv-rights-and-responsibilities-of-the-ccc-member" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>(IV) Rights and responsibilities of the CCC member</strong></h3> <ol><li><p>NULS hopes to build a module repository covering 80% of underlying technologies in the blockchain field. We aim to lower the entry threshold of blockchain industry by increasing the modules in the repository. In doing so, the enterprises will undertake a much lower chain issuing cost and users will find it easier to use chains. We believe that only in this way can blockchain technology become a part of our daily life.</p></li> <li><p>The technology community will work with the core team to build a brand new architecture – NULS 2.0, which will enable NULS modules to work independently and the low-coupling module shall interact via the interface defined by standard. Then, developers (regardless of development language) can use adept programming languages as long as they comply with NULS module standard to develop the functional modules they need to enrich the module repository.</p></li> <li><p>After that, NULS will launch Chain Factory, a chain creation tool based on the module repository. If the developer is very clear about parameters of the blockchain developed by himself / herself, like the consensus mechanism, block size and block producing time, even if he / she doesn’t have much understanding of the underlying technology, he / she can own a public chain within several minutes in 4 simple steps (of course consortium blockchain and private blockchain are available). The public blockchain development time, which is usually six months to one year, is greatly reduced.</p></li> <li><p>Technology community will take part in all of the work mentioned above. You can bring forward any suggestions and comments to our plans regarding the technology community.</p></li> <li><p>The CCC members, the same as the core team members, shall have the right to know, participate in, assent or object to project progress.</p></li></ol> <h2 id="v-contributor"><a href="#v-contributor" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>V.
