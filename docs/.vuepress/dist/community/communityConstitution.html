NULS Community Profile</strong></h2> <p>NULS is a blockchain infrastructure for customizable services and a global open-source community. The designed technical architecture of NULS consists of a micro-kernel and functional modules. With innovative ideas on reducing the main block chain and decoupling events and services, high modularization on underlying architecture is achieved. The NULS project, following the principles of hot plugging, modularization and parallel expansion, provides smart contracts, multi-chain mechanism and cross-chain consensus to reduce cost of development and use, and to promote the application of blockchain in the commercial field. With the proposal of basic framework containing modular thinking and multi-chain mechanism, NULS upholds the “chain” as its core development philosophy and is striving for building a core product - “Chain Factory” where users can select core function modules as they like to create their own blockchains on the NULS chain network and define their own business logic with little programming, to include smart contracts.</p> <p><strong>NULS community is an organization of a group of people who highly assent to NULS community culture and philosophy and have the same purpose and vision to work for the development of NULS community ecology.</strong> NULS community members include the NULS Foundation, Council members, contributors, the open-source technology community - CODE CRAFT COUNCIL (CCC) and other all NULS Holders.</p> <h2 id="ii-nuls-foundation"><a href="#ii-nuls-foundation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>II.

We aim to lower the entry threshold of blockchain industry by increasing the modules in the repository. In doing so, the enterprises will undertake a much lower chain issuing cost and users will find it easier to use chains. We believe that only in this way can blockchain technology become a part of our daily life.</p></li> <li><p>The technology community will work with the core team to build a brand new architecture – NULS 2.0, which will enable NULS modules to work independently and the low-coupling module shall interact via the interface defined by standard. Then, developers (regardless of development language) can use adept programming languages as long as they comply with NULS module standard to develop the functional modules they need to enrich the module repository.</p></li> <li><p>After that, NULS will launch Chain Factory, a chain creation tool based on the module repository. If the developer is very clear about parameters of the blockchain developed by himself / herself, like the consensus mechanism, block size and block producing time, even if he / she doesn’t have much understanding of the underlying technology, he / she can own a public chain within several minutes in 4 simple steps (of course consortium blockchain and private blockchain are available).
