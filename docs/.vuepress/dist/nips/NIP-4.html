Once smart contracts are launched on the NULS main-net, there will be a community voting tool. Appointments of the ambassadors should be decided by the community. During this time, community members have given many suggestions, so we have set up some new detailed campaigning rules for the ambassadors. This will be the first step toward community autonomy, which is an important goal for NULS. It requires many fundamental tools, as well as the support from everyone in the community.</p> <h2 id="specification"><a href="#specification" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Specification</h2> <p>The following is a specification of the Ambassadors participate in the election rules.</p> <h1 id="ambassadors-participate-in-the-election-rules"><a href="#ambassadors-participate-in-the-election-rules" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ambassadors participate in the election rules</h1> <h2 id="_1-introduction-of-nuls-ambassadors"><a href="#_1-introduction-of-nuls-ambassadors" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. Introduction of NULS Ambassadors</h2> <p>The NULS ambassadors conduct community-building and development in various parts of the world. NULS ambassadors are divided into countries or regions, and each is limited to the selection of one NULS ambassador.</p> <p>The ambassador for each country will be chosen through competition by vote.

Duties and Compensation for NULS Ambassadors</h2> <p>a. A candidate for the NULS ambassador is required to create a NULS node.</p> <p>b. A candidate is required to agree with the values of NULS, understand the core knowledge of NULS, and respect members of the NULS community.</p> <p>c. The appointment of NULS ambassadors is implemented through community voting. Candidates are able to apply for the position of ambassador during the first two months of a quarter. At the beginning of the third month of a quarter, the NULS team will initiate the voting and 1/3 of the candidates with the most votes will become the new ambassadors. For example, if 10 persons apply, 4 candidates with the most votes will get elected.</p> <p>d. Ambassadors are required to publicly display their work report summary to the whole community at the end of each month, and show the development and growth of the community as well as their plan for the next month on the forum. The work report should include expenses for that month.</p> <p>e. The dismissal of an ambassador: Any node can initiate a vote to dismiss an ambassador. The vote will last for a period of 7 days. If the votes in support the dismissal exceeds 50%, then the ambassador will be dismissed. The ambassador who is dismissed cannot participate in the ambassadors’ election again for 3 months.</p> <p>f. Each NULS ambassador will be entrusted with 200,000 NULS tokens from the community fund of NULS Foundation. The elected NULS ambassadors can use 80% of the consensus rewards for community building, and the remaining 20% will returned to the community fund.</p> <p>g. 80% is the initial parameter fir ambassador nodes. With market fluctuations, this parameter can be modified. Any node can propose to change this parameter, with a voting period of 15 days. If the voting volume exceeds 5 million NULS tokens and the supporting votes are 70% or higher, the vote is considered passed, and the NULS Foundation will execute.</p> <p>h. NULS ambassadors can apply for a budget from the NULS Foundation for major developments. The budget is open to all community members, and a budget vote will be initiated for it. The voting period is 15 days, and if the voting volume exceeds 10 million NULS tokens, and the supporting votes reach 70% or higher, the vote is considered passed and the NULS Foundation will execute.</p> <h2 id="_3-how-to-participate-in-the-election"><a href="#_3-how-to-participate-in-the-election" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.  How to participate in the election</h2> <p>a. Publish the work report for the previous month and the work plan for the next month:</p> <p>Please post on the NULS forum: <a href="https://community.nuls.world/t/elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://community.nuls.world/t/elections<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>b.
