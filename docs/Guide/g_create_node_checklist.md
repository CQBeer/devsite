# Create an NULS Node

#####If this is your first time to create an SCO a node:
##### NULS recommends creating your node for the Test Network first.
##### If you are creating an SCO-POCM node, NULS insists that you create your node for the Test Network first. (The author of this checklist promises, that you will save yourself frustration and headache.)

For the test network, make sure to open the server ports 18001 and 18002.
For the Mainnet, make sure to open the server ports  8001 and 8002. 
If these ports are not open, your node will not successfully communicate with the blockchain.
# Step 0 - Test and Mainnet reference details


Test net:
- Light wallet test environment：[https://beta.wallet.nuls.io](https://beta.wallet.nuls.io)
- Explorer test environment:[http://beta.nulscan.io/](http://beta.nulscan.io/)
- POCM test environment：[http://beta.pocm.nuls.io/](http://beta.pocm.nuls.io/)

Mainnet:
- Light wallet test environment：[https://wallet.nuls.io](https://wallet.nuls.io)
- Explorer test environment:[http://nulscan.io/](http://nulscan.io/)
- POCM test environment：[http://pocm.nuls.io/](http://pocm.nuls.io/)

Test nuls accounts are prefixed with: tNULS
Mainnet nuls accounts are prefixed with: NULS

# Step 1 - Setup

## Step 1 - Setup your server 
Choose a cloud provider.  At this time known cloud services with good record running nodes are:  hetzner,  ovh, aws lightsailing. Also you can consult the telegram channel Nuls node owners.

Here is the configuration NULS recommends ***:  
- 16GB RAM minimum (32 Gb recommended for future proof network utilization), 
- 4 cores (8 cores recommended, future proof),
- 200 GB hard disk

We recommend Linux: CentOS 7, OpenSuse, Ubuntu, Fedora    What Window Server OS are you running?

## Step 1 - setup your accounts
For your node you will need 3 NULS accounts.


1. Agent account - the agent account contains the nuls required to initiate the SCO, which is 20,000 nuls. ***
2. Rewards account - he rewards account will contain the income from your node, so it is currently empty.
3. Package account -  sometimes called packer.  Every time a block is “packed” it must be signed.  The package account is used to do that. Notice the package account has a different password. When we install your SCO on the main net it will have a tough password, but for test it has a default password.


Account rules and recommendations:
1. The package account is uniquely assigned to your node.  That is, it can only be used by your node. 
2. The password for the package account must be nuls123456   ***
3. The password(s) for the Agent and Rewards accounts are generated by you and should be very secure.
4. Although you can use the agent and awards account for other functions, it is recommended that you dedicate those accounts to the specific node.

For test: you can request nuls for the agent account by contacting Kathy Norman.   *** how should we handle this?

# Step 2 - For POCM begin work on "Submit basic information"

In the POCM Tutorial manual, locate the "Submit basic information" section and enter the information.  You can do this step concurrently with the other steps. 
You will submit this twice, once for test and once for mainnet.

# Step 3 -- following the instructions for the section "Create a Node"

1. For the test network, make sure to open the server ports 18001 and 18002.
   For the Mainnet, make sure to open the server ports  8001 and 8002. 
   If these ports are not open, your node will not successfully communicate with the blockchain.


At the end of this step you will have an active consensus node on test or mainnet.
