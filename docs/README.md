## NULS2.0 Alpha Version is released

Dear users:

It is a great honor to announce that the NULS2.0 Alpha version has been released at 10:30 am, Beijing time: 2019-03-28. We sincerely invite you to participate in the internal test.

The NULS core team innovatively introduced micro-service thinking into the design of the underlying infrastructure of the blockchain, designed the software application as a service suite that can be independently deployed, and introduced the most advanced ideas in this architectural design into the module design, making the module as flexible as a program that can be independently started. This modular architecture with no programming language thresholds combined with microservices is what we call NULS 2.0. In this architecture, the coupling degree between modules is smaller. The development of multiple languages greatly improves the contribution of code and the convenience of users. At the same time, it is easier to expand. Meanwhile, the chain factory and cross-chain module will also be designed on this architecture.

The Alpha version test mainly includes:
- Full functionality of the Linux wallet, such as account creation, import, transfer, node creation, etc
- Build blockchain based on NULS2.0 core modules
- Build blockchain including [business module](/NULS2.0/developModule.html)
