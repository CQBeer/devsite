title: Why emphasize the use of modularity
---

Since the birth of Bitcoin, early blockchain applications have been a single application that serves a specific purpose.

Anyone who wants to multiplex Bitcoin-related code can only go deep into the entire Bitcoin project and learn all the details.
Adjust the code and implement the function according to your actual situation.

Since its inception, NULS is a PaaS for business. It has only one goal: to reduce the cost of using blockchain technology. Only with a modular bottom layer design can the blockchain become remodelable.

## Why is this design?
Business needs are changing rapidly, and it is impossible for NULS developers to write a commercial blockchain system that covers 100% of the environment in advance. Use a minimal functional module to build together a blockchain system. As much as possible to meet as many business needs as possible at the lowest cost.

## brings value
At present, the NULS open source modules are based on the MIT protocol, which provides good support for several commonly used blockchain networking models. There is no charge for companies to use code based on these modules. At the same time, thanks to the NULS Global Developer Program. Businesses can choose to use the free or paid authorization module provided by the community. It is even possible to screen developers from the familiar NULS underlying layer, so that enterprises can quickly build a commercial blockchain network that meets their business needs.

## Anymore?

NULS hopes to build a bridge between enterprises and developers and connect with NULS users worldwide to participate in the consensus.
Enterprises only need to store the hash of the side chain to the NULS main network, which can significantly improve the data credibility of closed source enterprises without sacrificing the security of sensitive data.
